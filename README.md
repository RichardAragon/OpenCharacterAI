Open Source Character AI

Welcome to Open Character AI! We currently have the following character models for you to choose from: 

- AI Batman
- Ai Bundy
- AI Jedi Padawan
- Creative Writing Bot 5000
- Comedian Bot 5000

You can choose between a Quick Start experience to get up and running quickly with less characterization or a deeper fine tuning process that will provide a very rich user experience. The quick start will have you up and running in 5-10 minutes whereas the longer fine tuning can take 30-40 minutes. To get started, open your desired notebook experience, select the appropriate dataset for your particular Character Selection, then run all of the cells in the notebook. 

To ask different prompts, simply change the prompt in the last cell and re-run it. Re-run it as much as you like. Re-run the notebook again and again as much as you like.

The models run and are stored locally (or in this case Google Colab). They are not calling out to API services, utilizing OpenAI API, etc. They are not AI wrappers. 

The models all use a generalized training dataset for their specific function mixed with the PFAF3 datasets.
